00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.560
This is the largest green roof in New York City.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.040
It's in the middle of bustling Manhattan, on top of the Javits Convention Centerâ€”

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.700
a behemoth of a building with a six-block footprint.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.480
But the roof hasn't always been green.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.180
Before 2014, it was totally barren.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.880
Now, just a few years later, when people walk out onto the roof, they say things like:

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.940
"Amazing," "That's great," "I didn't expect this," "What a surprise."

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.940
But besides the great reactions, there are practical benefits.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.220
We have 300,000 bees.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.760
We've seen 25 different species of birds on the roof.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.700
We reduced the temperature up here by about six degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.500
And we also save about 7 million gallons of stormwater runoff

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.440
that's absorbed in the soil and the plants that are on our roof.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.560
We've been able to reduce our energy
consumption by about 26 percent,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.940
and that translated for us last year
into a saving of about 3 million dollars.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.180
That is impressive.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.400
How does one green roof get so much done?

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.940
And what are all of the NOT green roofs in New York City doing with their lives?

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.580
First, let's see how much roof space actually exists.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.920
You know, they are a major part of urban landscapes.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.320
The the round number that most of us think exists is about 1 billion square feet.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.060
One billion with a 'b.'

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.160
That's like 22 times the size of Central Park, in roofs.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.140
And in most cities, what isn't roof is another impermeable surface

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.660
like road, sidewalk, or parking
lot.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.460
And these surfaces create a lot of problems for cities

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.060
That green roofs can actually help solve.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.320
Let's take a look at three of these issues. The first is
stormwater runoff.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.740
Rainwater goes in pipes. It combines
with what's called sanitary water.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.460
When there's too much rainwater, which happens hundreds of times a year around Manhattan,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.060
the wastewater treatment
systems shut down, and valves just let

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.140
the water just,  you know, shunt out into the rivers. You know, it's got human sewage.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.340
It's the biggest source of pathogens to
the Manhattan Island.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.020
With green roofs, that water instead of going into the
drain and polluting the environment,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.460
ends up just evaporating the atmosphere
through the leaves of these plants.

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.260
And then, there's what scientists call the "heat island effect,"

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.740
which basically means that cities are significantly warmer than the surrounding areas.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.960
I've seen asphalt roofs get up easily 170, 180 degrees Fahrenheit in the strong sunlight.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.780
They absorb about 90 to 95 percent of the sunlight.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.380
Green roofs, by comparison are close to air temperatures.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.960
Another problem green roofs can help solve is habitat loss.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.520
Cities can shrink or destroy the green space that's crucial for certain plants and
animals to survive.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.240
Currently a lot of species might occur in  smaller parks throughout the city that are relatively unconnected,

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.920
But having high densities of green roofs would allow those patches to be more connected.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.600
Letting, for example, butterflies travel from patch to patch with lots of stepping stones of green roofs in between.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.620
And these are just three of the problems that green roofs can help solve.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.800
But to really put a dent in any of these issues

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.520
cities would have to implement green roofs at a large scale.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.880
Stuart Gaffin, the research scientist
you heard from earlier,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.540
estimates that if all of New York City's 1 billion square feet of roof space were greened,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.440
those green roofs could lower the city's
temperature by nearly two degrees Fahrenheit

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.540
and absorb over 10 billion
gallons of stormwater each year.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.640
As cities continue to grow, all that empty roof space starts to look more and more like an opportunity,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.480
an untapped resource,

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.060
a future ecosystem of problem-solving meadows

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:50.720
in the sky.
