00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.180
There’s a reason that summers in the city are so hot,

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.680
and it’s probably easiest to explain why

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.380
with thermal vision.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.480
It shows the heat all around me

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.020
and also the coldness of this ice cream cone.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.660
Cities are often hotter than their suburbs

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.200
due to a phenomenon known as “the heat island effect.”

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.580
All of that asphalt,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.260
concrete,

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.280
dark rooftops

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.700
and tall buildings—

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.280
they absorb and store heat.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.060
And there are a lot of people using a lot of energy—

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.220
driving cars, riding subways, running the AC.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.980
All of these materials and activities

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.780
either create or retain heat.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.360
And all that stored heat causes steeper nighttime highs …

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.560
when people would otherwise have a chance to cool down.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.680
The way all these heat-storing elements are laid out

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560
matters quite a bit.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.060
In cities laid out in grids,

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.920
like Phoenix, Chicago, or Washington, D.C.,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.100
the buildings are closer together,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.000
like closely packed coals in a fire, keeping heat in.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.660
More space between buildings

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.300
creates more circulation.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.160
Another way to combat this heat island effect

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.620
is through green space.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.880
Parks, trees, plants—

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.380
they don’t absorb as much heat …

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.920
they actually send water back in the atmosphere.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.480
Between all those hot buildings, that cools things off.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.460
Another solution is color.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.180
Light colors reflect sunlight back into the atmosphere

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.820
instead of storing it as heat.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.520
It's easiest to see in crosswalks,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.180
and it's true for the color of buildings

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.920
and other urban surfaces, too.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.020
And one long-game way to combat the heat island effect

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.240
is to avoid using air conditioning when you don’t need it.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.160
AC uses a ton of electricity and creates a feedback loop.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.940
When we get that electricity from coal or natural gas,

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.460
that puts more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere …

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.820
which warms the planet …

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.080
making cities even hotter.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.280
But this isn’t just about comfort.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.280
Today, heat waves kill more people

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.180
than any other extreme weather event.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.520
More than tornadoes, hurricanes and even floods.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.620
City populations keep growing,

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.600
and those cities are only getting hotter.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.840
